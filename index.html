							<h2>Introduction</h2>
							<p>Born in the humble town of Franklin, I feel like I started my life the right way.<br /></p>
							<p>I'm currently a senior at Heard County High School, and a Dual-Enrollment Freshman at the University of West Georgia - aspiring Software Developer and Programmer.</p>
							<p>I began as a Java Developer, making addons and plugins for Minecraft, a multi-million dollar, multi-platform sandbox video game. I then shifted towards different programming languages in late 2016, beginning with C++, quickly followed by Python.</p>
							<p>I have been in the software development field for 6 years now, beginning in late 7th grade!</p>
							<p>Outside of programming, I'm very athletic, and pride myself in playing Football, Wrestling, and keeping a very active lifestyle; including exercising daily and staying in shape.</p>

							<h2>How I Got into Programming</h2>
							<p>I got into programming shortly after beginning to play Minecraft. I was playing multiplayer when I was introduced to a server called "ItsJerryandHarry", a popular server at the time.</p>
							<p>Intrigued by the montra, "100% custom coded", I did research late at night (on a school night!) as to how someone could make their server custom. What I soon learned was that they had made small programs, called plugins, to add-on to Minecraft!</p>
							<p>Several months of YouTube tutorials and failures later, I began Java programming. It wasn't until late high school that I began to experiment with anything outside of Minecraft, and it wasn't until senior year that I began to experiment with other programming languages.</p>
